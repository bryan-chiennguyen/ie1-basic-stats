| * eb5459b Updated the BasicStatsTest class to be consistent with the use of the Strategy design pattern.
| * 4112144 Modified the BasicStatsGUI class to use the new SimpleStatView class.
| * 83c951d Added the SimpleStatView class and its helper classes to apply the Strategy design pattern for the simple statistics (count, mean, median, maximum). Modified the BasicStatsGUI class to use this new class. Updated the BasicStatsTest class to be consistent with this.
| * 184c857 Modified the BasicStatsTest class to add the testViewUndoAllowed and testViewUndoDisallowed methods. Also modified this class to add the setupAndCheckViewPreconditions helper method.
| * bff46a6 Modified the AddNumberViewController class update method to always clear itself.
| * fc42b42 Extended the BasicStatsApp to support undo functionality. Modified the BasicStatsModel class to add the undo method. Added the UndoViewController class. Modified the BasicStatsGUI class to add an UndoViewController and the undo method. Modified the NumbersView class update method to support both add number and undo. Modified the BasicStatsTest class to be consistent with these modifications. Updated the README and javadoc.
| * 29a7fc6 Bug fixed the BasicStatsTest class testViewResetConfiguration method. The mean and median were in the incorrect order.

| * 115c401 For the MVC architecture pattern, added the model package. Refactored the BasicStatsModel class into the model package.
| * 43c8cc2 Refactored the relevant code elements (data field and getArrayDouble method) from the BasicStatsApp class into the BasicStatsModel class.
| * 79c45fd Added an initial version of the BasicStatsModel class to support the MVC architecture pattern. This class currently specifies the API but does not implement the method bodies.
